<h2> <u> About me </u></h2>
</a>
Hello, I am Sunil Kumar Pandey, fifth year undergraduate at IIT Kanpur. Currently, I am majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science & Engineering. I was born and brought up in Faridabad. I did all my education apart from my undergrads there. Talking about the fields in which I have developed interest over the years, I would say Algorithms and Machine learning has been the best of the lot so far for me. Apart from the academics, I watch cricket a lot and hence(:P) major portion of my time goes in watching that. At other times, I solve Rubik's cube or read stuffs for "You read and You know things".

<h2> <u> Intership </u></h2>
<h3> <u> Summer'18 at Goldman Sachs </u></h3>
I spent this summer in Bangalore at Goldman Sachs, an American multinational investment bank and financial services company. I was in the Compliance Division of the Firm. I worked primarily on finding topic tags for documents. Though topic modelling is a well solved problem in itself but giving words corresponding to each topic is still an unchartered territory. This was something that made the problem difficult but fun to solve.
<h3> <u> Research Internship at New York University </u></h3>
Last summer, I was in NYC. First thing first, a great place to be at. Talking about my project, I was working under Prof. Yao Wang at New York University on predicting user view in a 360 Degree Video using machine learning techniques. If you wish to know more about this project, feel free to <a href="#contacts">contact</a> me.
<h3> <u> Remote Work at IITK under UTD Professor </u></h3>
IIT Kanpur came up with a joint internship program in summmer'16 where few selected sophomores got an opportunity to remotely work under Professor at University of Texas, Dallas. I was fortunate to got an opportunity to work under Prof. Ovidiu Daescu in the field of Algorithms. The Problem was to find two edge disjoint spanning trees in a graph with 2n-2 edges if possible. Though, the problem is already solved for general number of edges but the project aimed at exploiting the given constraints of edges in the graph and reducing the time complexity significantly. More details about the project can be found at <a href="Projects/disjointTrees.pdf">here.

<h2> <u> Project Work:- </u></h2>
<h3> <u> GOGO, MIPS Compiler for GoLang </u></h3>
This was a course project done under Prof. Subhajit Roy at IIT Kanpur. As the name suggests, the project aimed at making a MIPS Compiler for Go language in Go. We used the gocc tool kit as parser and lexer tool. We also did few low level optimizations so as to make the compilation as fast as possible. The project code can be found <a href="https://github.com/kpsunil/gogo">here</a>.
<h3> <u> Vehicle Recognition </u></h3>
This project was done under Prof. Gaurav Pandey at IIT Kanpur to design a framework that can recognise vehicle using the images of number plates. A trivial way to do it is to do OCR on the number plate image and find the vehicle registration number. The problem with this method is that fails to work on the Indian vehicle where the number plates do not have standard font type or size. Also, the condition of the number plate brings the accuracy down even more. And hence this can't be used for implementation of a system that handles most of the corner cases and not just the general one. To find more details about how the problem was approached, feel free to <a href="#contacts">contact</a> me.
<h3> <u> Visual Question Answer </u></h3>
This was a course project done in course Natual Language Processing under Prof. Harish Karnick at IIT Kanpur. The problem is given an image and a question that is related to the image, design a model that generates the answer. The project involved reading earlier researches like attention models to this problem and propsoing our own. More details about the project can be found at <a href="Projects/VQA.pdf">here.
